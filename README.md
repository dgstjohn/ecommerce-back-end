# README for bootcamp e-commerce back end challenge
## OBJECTIVE
Build the back end for an e-commerce site, linking SQL queries from Sequelize code to a database containing product categories, products and associated searchable tags.
## CODE
The codebase includes models used to create the database tables in Sequelize, the API routes, the connectivity JS files, a schema to create the database and pre-provided seed files, and the server.js file. Dependencies include dotenv, mysql2, Express.js, Sequelize, and nodemon to avoid manual server restarts.
## DEMO VIDEOS
Two videos with a walk-through of the working application are available. The first is at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2GI9-5I3y0heusOLCOhcyL3CR_5mrK5/view and the second continuance is at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XTU1FYdvAZO-aeveOtXtWjDTPFgUOTXi/view (both are set to public viewability).
